# REVIEW METHODOLOGY

## What to look for

1. **Correctness** — Logic errors, off-by-one, null/undefined handling, wrong types, missing awaits
2. **Edge cases** — Empty arrays, missing keys, concurrent access, error paths not tested
3. **Security** — Injection (SQL, command, XSS), secrets in code, unsafe deserialization, unvalidated input at system boundaries
4. **Integration risks** — Breaking changes to shared interfaces, missing migration steps, dependency version conflicts
5. **Spec verification** — Does the code actually fulfill the PR description / linked issue requirements?

## What NOT to comment on

- Style preferences already enforced by linters/formatters
- Nitpicks that don't affect correctness or maintainability
- Suggestions for future work unrelated to this PR
- Code outside the diff unless it's directly affected by the changes

## Severity guide

Use these prefixes in your comment bodies:
- `🔴 bug:` — Likely incorrect behavior
- `🟡 issue:` — Potential problem or missed edge case
- `💭 question:` — Clarification needed before approving
- `💡 suggestion:` — Optional improvement, take it or leave it

# OUTPUT

Emit a single `<output>` block as the **last thing** in your response. Valid JSON, field names exact.

## Example

<output>
{
  "summary": "Overall solid implementation. Found one bug in the error handling path and a potential race condition in the cache invalidation. Two minor suggestions included.",
  "inlineComments": [
    {
      "path": "src/services/cache.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "🔴 bug: `delete` is called before the async write completes — if the write fails, the cache entry is already gone. Await the write or move the delete into the `.then()` callback."
    },
    {
      "path": "src/api/handler.ts",
      "line": 15,
      "body": "🟡 issue: `req.body` is used without validation. If the upstream proxy strips the content-type header, this will silently be `undefined`."
    }
  ],
  "replies": [
    {
      "commentId": "PRRC_kwDOPSEf9c8AAAABX1234",
      "body": "Agree — the guard added in the latest commit doesn't cover the `null` case mentioned here."
    }
  ]
}
</output>

## Empty output

If the code looks correct and you have no findings:

<output>
{ "summary": "LGTM — no issues found.", "inlineComments": [], "replies": [] }
</output>
